# üìò Day 9

## Conditionals

By default, statements in Python script are executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two way:

- Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
- Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover _if_, _else_, _elif_ statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in previous sections will be useful here.

### If Condition

In python and other programming languages the key word _if_ is used to check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. Remember the indentation after the colon.

```py
# syntax
if condition:
    this part of code runs for truthy conditions
```

**Example: 1**

```py
a = 3
if a > 0:
    print('A is a positive number')
# A is a positive number
```

As you can see in the example above, 3 is greater than 0. The condition was true and the block code was executed. However, if the condition is false, we do not see the result. In order to see the result of the falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be _else_.

### If Else

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will run.

```py
# syntax
if condition:
    this part of code runs for truthy conditions
else:
     this part of code runs for false conditions
```

**Example: **

```py
a = 3
if a < 0:
    print('A is a negative number')
else:
    print('A is a positive number')
```

The condition above proves false, therefore the else block was executed. How about if our condition is more than two? We could use _ elif_.

### If Elif Else

In our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions but multiple conditions. As similar to life, programming is also full of conditions. We use _elif_ when we have multiple conditions.

```py
# syntax
if condition:
    code
elif condition:
    code
else:
    code

```

**Example: **

```py
a = 0
if a > 0:
    print('A is a positive number')
elif a < 0:
    print('A is a negative number')
else:
    print('A is zero')
```

### Short Hand

```py
# syntax
code if condition else code
```

**Example: **

```py
a = 3
print('A is positive') if a > 0 else print('A is negative') # first condition met, 'A is positive' will be printed
```

### Nested Conditions

Conditions can be nested

```py
# syntax
if condition:
    code
    if condition:
    code
```

**Example: **

```py
a = 0
if a > 0:
    if a % 2 == 0:
        print('A is a positive and even integer')
    else:
        print('A is a positive number')
elif a == 0:
    print('A is zero')
else:
    print('A is a negative number')

```

We can avoid writing nested condition by using logical operator _and_.

### If Condition and Logical Operators

```py
# syntax
if condition and condition:
    code
```

**Example: **

```py
a = 0
if a > 0 and a % 2 == 0:
        print('A is an even and positive integer')
elif a > 0 and a % 2 !=  0:
     print('A is a positive integer')
elif a == 0:
    print('A is zero')
else:
    print('A is negative')
```

### If and Or Logical Operators

```py
# syntax
if condition or condition:
    code
```

**Example: **

```py
user = 'James'
access_level = 3
if user == 'admin' or access_level >= 4:
        print('Access granted!')
else:
    print('Access denied!')
```

üåï You are doing great.Never give up because great things take time. You have just completed day 9 challenges and you are 9 steps a head in to your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and muscles.

## üíª Exercises: Day 9

### Exercises: Level 1

1.  Get user input using input(‚ÄúEnter your age: ‚Äù). If user is 18 or older, give feedback: You are old enough to drive. If below 18 give feedback to wait for the missing amount of years. Output:
    ```sh
    Enter your age: 30
    You are old enough to learn to drive.
    Output:
    Enter your age: 15
    You need 3 more years to learn to drive.
    ```
2.  Compare the values of my_age and your_age using if ‚Ä¶ else. Who is older (me or you)? Use input(‚ÄúEnter your age: ‚Äù) to get the age as input. You can use a nested condition to print 'year' for 1 year difference in age, 'years' for bigger differences, and a custom text if my_age = your_age. Output:
    ```sh
    Enter your age: 30
    You are 5 years older than me.
    ```
3.  Get two numbers from the user using input prompt. If a is greater than b return a is greater than b, if a is less b return a is smaller than b, else a is equal to b. Output:

```sh
Enter number one: 4
Enter number two: 3
4 is greater than 3
```

    ### Exercises: Level 2

   1. Write a code which gives grade to students according to theirs scores:
   
        ```sh
        80-100, A
        70-89, B
        60-69, C
        50-59, D
        0-49, F
        ```
1. Check if the season is Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer. If the user input is:
    September, October or November, the season is Autumn.
    December, January or February, the season is Winter.
    March, April or May, the season is Spring
    June, July or August, the season is Summer
2.  The following list contains some fruits:
    ```sh
    fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
    ```
    If a fruit doesn't exist in the list add the fruit to the list and print the modified list. If the fruit exists print('That fruit already exist in the list') 

    ### Exercises: Level 3

   1. Here we have a person dictionary. Feel free to modify it!
   
```py
        person={
    'first_name': 'Asabeneh',
    'last_name': 'Yetayeh',
    'age': 250,
    'country': 'Finland',
    'is_marred': True,
    'skills': ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node', 'MongoDB', 'Python'],
    'address': {
        'street': 'Space street',
        'zipcode': '02210'
    }
    }
```

     * Check if the person dictionary has skills key, if so print out the middle skill in the skills list.
     * Check if the person dictionary has skills key, if so check if the person has 'Python' skill and print out the result.
     * If a person skills has only JavaScript and React, print('He is a front end developer'), if the person skills has Node, Python, MongoDB, print('He is a backend developer'), if the person skills has React, Node and MongoDB, Print('He is a fullstack developer'), else print('unknown title') - for more accurate results more conditions can be nested!
     * If the person is married and if he lives in Finland, print the information in the following format:

```py
    Asabeneh Yetayeh lives in Finland. He is married.
```

# üìò Day 10

## Loops

Life is full of routines. In programming we also do lots of repetitive tasks. In order to handle repetitive task programming languages use loops. Python programming language also provides the following types of two loops:

1. while loop
2. for loop

### While Loop

We use the reserved word _while_ to make a while loop. It is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the lines of code after the loop will be continued to be executed.

```py
  # syntax
while condition:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
#prints from 0 to 4
```

In the above while loop, the condition becomes false when count is 5. That is when the loop stops.
If we are interested to run block of code once the condition is no longer true, we can use _else_.

```py
  # syntax
while condition:
    code goes here
else:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
else:
    print(count)
```

The above loop condition will be false when count is 5 and the loop stops, and execution starts the else statement. As a result 5 will be printed.


### Break and Continue - Part 1

- Break: We use break when we like to get out of or stop the loop.

```py
# syntax
while condition:
    code goes here
    if another_condition:
        break
```

**Example:**

```py
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
    if count == 3:
        break
```

The above while loop only prints 0, 1, 2, but when it reaches 3 it stops.

- Continue: With the continue statement we can skip the current iteration, and continue with the next:

```py
  # syntax
while condition:
    code goes here
    if another_condition:
        continue
```

**Example:**

```py
count = 0
while count < 5:
    if count == 3:
        continue
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
```

The above while loop only prints 0, 1, 2 and 4 (skips 3).

### For Loop

A _for_ keyword is used to make a for loop, similar with other programming languages, but with some syntax differences. Loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

- For loop with list

```py
# syntax
for iterator in lst:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers: # number is temporary name to refer to the list's items, valid only inside this loop
    print(number)       # the numbers will be printed line by line, from 0 to 5
```

- For loop with string

```py
# syntax
for iterator in string:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
language = 'Python'
for letter in language:
    print(letter)


for i in range(len(language)):
    print(language[i])
```

- For loop with tuple

```py
# syntax
for iterator in tpl:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
numbers = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

- For loop with dictionary
  Looping through a dictionary gives you the key of the dictionary.

```py
  # syntax
for iterator in dct:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
person = {
    'first_name':'Asabeneh',
    'last_name':'Yetayeh',
    'age':250,
    'country':'Finland',
    'is_marred':True,
    'skills':['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node', 'MongoDB', 'Python'],
    'address':{
        'street':'Space street',
        'zipcode':'02210'
    }
}
for key in person:
    print(key)

for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value) # this way we get both keys and values printed out
```

- Loops in set

```py
# syntax
for iterator in st:
    code goes here
```

**Example:**

```py
it_companies = {'Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'}
for company in it_companies:
    print(company)
```

### Break and Continue - Part 2

Short reminder:
_Break_: We use break when we like to stop our loop before it is completed.

```py
# syntax
for iterator in sequence:
    code goes here
    if condition:
        break
```

**Example:**

```py
numbers = (0,1,2,3,4,5)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
    if number == 3:
        break
```

In the above example, the loop stops when it reaches 3.

Continue: We use continue when we like to skip some of the steps in the iteration of the loop.

```py
  # syntax
for iterator in sequence:
    code goes here
    if condition:
        continue
```

**Example:**

```py
numbers = (0,1,2,3,4,5)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print('Next number should be ', number + 1) if number != 5 else print("loop's end") # for short hand conditions need both if and else statements
print('outside the loop')
```

In the example above, if the number equals 3, the step *after* the condition (but inside the loop) is skipped and the execution of the loop continues if there are any iterations left.

### The Range Function

The _range()_ function is used list of numbers. The _range(start, end, step)_ takes three parameters: starting, ending and increment. By default it starts from 0 and the increment is 1. The range sequence needs at least 1 argument (end).
Creating sequences using range

```py
lst = list(range(11)) 
print(lst) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
st = set(range(1, 11))    # 2 arguments indicate start and end of the sequence, step set to default 1
print(st) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

lst = list(range(0,11,2))
print(lst) # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
st = set(range(0,11,2))
print(st) #  {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
```

```py
# syntax
for iterator in range(start, end, step):
```

**Example:**

```py
for number in range(11):
    print(number)   # prints 0 to 10, not including 11
```

### Nested For Loop

We can write loops inside a loop.

```py
# syntax
for x in y:
    for t in x:
        print(t)
```

**Example:**

```py
person = {
    'first_name': 'Asabeneh',
    'last_name': 'Yetayeh',
    'age': 250,
    'country': 'Finland',
    'is_marred': True,
    'skills': ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node', 'MongoDB', 'Python'],
    'address': {
        'street': 'Space street',
        'zipcode': '02210'
    }
}
for key in person:
    if key == 'skills':
        for skill in person['skills']:
            print(skill)
```

### For Else

If we want to execute some message when the loop ends, we use else.

```py
# syntax
for iterator in range(start, end, step):
    do something
else:
    print('The loop ended')
```

**Example:**

```py
for number in range(11):
    print(number)   # prints 0 to 10, not including 11
else:
    print('The loop stops at', number)
```

### Pass

In python when statement is required (after semicolon), but we don't like to execute any code there, we can write the word _pass_ to avoid errors. Also we can use it as a placeholder, for future statements.

**Example:**

```py
for number in range(6):
    pass
```
