## Environment Setup

### Installing Python

To run a python script you need to install python. Let's [download](https://www.python.org/) python.
If your are a windows user. Click the button encircled in red.

If you are a macOS user. Click the button encircled in red.

[![installing on Windows](./images/installing_on_macOS.png)](https://www.python.org/)

To check if python is installed write the following command on your device terminal.

```shell
python --version
```

![Python Version](./images/python_versio.png)

As you can see from the terminal, I am using _Python 3.7.5_ version at the moment. Your version of Python might be different from mine by but it should be 3.6 or above. If you mange to see the python version, well done. Python has been installed on your machine. Continue to the next section.

### Python Shell

Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it does not need to be compiled. It means it executes the code line by line. Python comes with a _Python Shell (Python Interactive Shell)_. It is used to execute a single python command and get the result.

Python Shell waits for the Python code from the user. When you enter the code, it interprets the code and shows the result in the next line.
Open your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write:

```shell
python
```

![Python Scripting Shell](./images/opening_python_shell.png)

The Python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write Python code(Python script). You will write your Python script next to this symbol >>> and then click Enter.
Let us write our very first script on the Python scripting shell.

![Python script on Python shell](./images/adding_on_python_shell.png)

Well done, you wrote your first Python script on Python interactive shell. How do we close the Python interactive shell ?
To close the shell, next to this symbol >> write **exit()** command and press Enter.

![Exit from python shell](./images/exit_from_shell.png)

Now, you know how to open the Python interactive shell and how to exit from it.

Python will give you results if you write scripts that Python understands, if not it returns errors. Let's make a deliberate mistake and see what Python will return.

![Invalid Syntax Error](./images/invalid_syntax_error.png)

As you can see from the returned error, Python is so clever that it knows the mistake we made and which was _Syntax Error: invalid syntax_. Using x as multiplication in Python is a syntax error because (x) is not a valid syntax in Python. Instead of (**x**) we use asterisk (*) for multiplication. The returned error clearly shows what to fix.

The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called *debugging*. Let us debug it by putting * in place of **x**.

![Fixing Syntax Error](./images/fixing_syntax_error.png)

Our bug was fixed, the code ran and we got a result we were expecting. As a programmer you will see such kind of errors on daily basis. It is good to know how to debug. To be good at debugging you should understand what kind of errors you are facing. Some of the Python errors you may encounter are *SyntaxError*, *IndexError*, *NameError*, *ModuleNotFoundError*, *KeyError*, *ImportError*, *AttributeError*, *TypeError*, *ValueError*, *ZeroDivisionError* etc. We will see more about different Python **_error types_** in later sections.

Let us practice more how to use Python interactive shell. Go to your terminal or command prompt and write the word **python**.

![Python Scripting Shell](./images/opening_python_shell.png)

The Python interactive shell is opened. Let us do some basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus,  exponential).

Let us do some maths first before we write any Python code:

- 2 + 3 = 5
- 3 - 2 = 1
- 3 \* 2 = 6
- 3 / 2 = 1.5
- 3 ^ 2 = 3 x 3 = 9

In python we have the following additional operations:

- 3 % 2 = 1 => which means finding the remainder
- 3 // 2 = 1 => which means removing the remainder

Let us change the above mathematical expressions to Python code. The Python shell has been opened and let us write a comment at the very beginning of the shell.

A _comment_ is a part of the code which is not executed by python. So we can leave some text in our code to make our code more readable. Python does not run the comment part. A comment in python starts with hash(#) symbol.
This is how you write a comment in python

```shell
 # comment starts with hash
 # this is a python comment, because it starts with a (#) symbol
```

Before we move on to the next section, let us practice more on the Python interactive shell. Close the opened shell by writing _exit()_ on the shell and open it again and let us practice how to write text on the Python shell.

### Installing Visual Studio Code

The Python interactive shell is good to try and test small script codes but it will not be for a big project. In real work environment, developers use different code editors to write codes. In this 30 days of Python programming challenge we will use visual studio code. Visual studio code is a very popular open source text editor. I am a fan of vscode and I would recommend to [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) visual studio code, but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have.

[![Visual Studio Code](./images/vscode.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

If you installed visual studio code, let us see how to use it.
If you prefer a video, you can follow this Visual Studio Code for Python [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7Cx4z-vSo)

#### How to use visual studio code

Open the visual studio code by double clicking the visual studio icon. When you open it you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons.

![Visual studio Code](./images/vscode_ui.png)

Create a folder named 30DaysOfPython on your desktop. Then open it using visual studio code.

![Opening Project on Visual studio](./images/how_to_open_project_on_vscode.png)

![Opening a project](./images/opening_project.png)

After opening it you will see shortcuts for creating files and folders inside of 30DaysOfPython project's directory. As you can see below, I have created the very first file, helloworld.py. You can do the same.

![Creating a python file](./images/helloworld.png)

After a long day of coding, you want to close your code editor, right? This is how you will close the opened project.

![Closing project](./images/closing_opened_project.png)

Congratulations, you have finished setting up the development environment. Let us start coding.
