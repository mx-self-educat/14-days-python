# ðŸ“˜ Day 3

## Boolean

A boolean data type represents one of the two values: _True_ or _False_. The use of these data types will be clear once we start using the comparison operator. The first letter **T** for True and **F** for False should be capital unlike JavaScript.
**Example: Boolean Values**

```py
print(True)
print(False)
```

## Operators

Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows that two values are equal, however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable. The table below shows the different types of python assignment operators, taken from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).

![Assignment Operators](../images/assignment_operators.png)

### Arithmetic Operators:

- Addition(+): a + b
- Subtraction(-): a - b
- Multiplication(*): a * b
- Division(/): a / b
- Modulus(%): a % b
- Floor division(//): a // b
- Exponentiation(**): a ** b

![Arithmetic Operators](../images/arithmetic_operators.png)

**Example:Integers**

```py
# Arithmetic Operations in Python
# Integers

print('Addition: ', 1 + 2)        # 3
print('Subtraction: ', 2 - 1)     # 1
print('Multiplication: ', 2 * 3)  # 6
print ('Division: ', 4 / 2)       # 2.0  Division in Python gives floating number
print('Division: ', 6 / 2)        # 3.0         
print('Division: ', 7 / 2)        # 3.5
print('Division without the remainder: ', 7 // 2)   # 3,  gives without the floating number or without the remaining
print ('Division without the remainder: ',7 // 3)   # 2
print('Modulus: ', 3 % 2)         # 1, Gives the remainder
print('Exponentiation: ', 2 ** 3) # 9 it means 2 * 2 * 2
```

**Example:Floats**

```py
# Floating numbers
print('Floating Point Number, PI', 3.14)
print('Floating Point Number, gravity', 9.81)
```

**Example:Complex numbers**

```py
# Complex numbers
print('Complex number: ', 1 + 1j)
print('Multiplying complex numbers: ',(1 + 1j) * (1 - 1j))
```

Let's declare a variable and assign a number data type. I am going to use single character variable but remember do not develop a habit of declaring such types of variables. Variable names should be all the time mnemonic.

**Example:**

```python
# Declaring the variable at the top first

a = 3 # a is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type
b = 2 # b is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type

# Arithmetic operations and assigning the result to a variable
total = a + b
diff = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b
remainder = a % b
floor_division = a // b
exponential = a ** b

# I should have used sum instead of total but sum is a built-in function - try to avoid overriding built-in functions
print(total) # if you do not label your print with some string, you never know where the result is coming from
print('a + b = ', total)
print('a - b = ', diff)
print('a * b = ', product)
print('a / b = ', division)
print('a % b = ', remainder)
print('a // b = ', floor_division)
print('a ** b = ', exponentiation)
```

**Example:**

```py
print('== Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus ==')

# Declaring values and organizing them together
num_one = 3
num_two = 4

# Arithmetic operations
total = num_one + num_two
diff = num_two - num_one
product = num_one * num_two
div = num_two / num_one
remainder = num_two % num_one

# Printing values with label
print('total: ', total)
print('difference: ', diff)
print('product: ', product)
print('division: ', div)
print('remainder: ', remainder)
```

Let us start start connecting the dots and start making use of what we already know to calculate (area, volume,density,  weight, perimeter, distance, force).

**Example:**

```py
# Calculating area of a circle
radius = 10                                 # radius of a circle
area_of_circle = 3.14 * radius ** 2         # two * sign means exponent or power
print('Area of a circle:', area_of_circle)

# Calculating area of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 20
area_of_rectangle = length * width
print('Area of rectangle:', area_of_rectangle)

# Calculating a weight of an object
mass = 75
gravity = 9.81
weight = mass * gravity
print(weight, 'N')                         # Adding unit to the weight

# Calculate the density of a liquid
mass = 75 # in Kg
volume = 0.075 # in cubic meter
density = mass / volume # 1000 Kg/m^3

```

### Comparison Operators

In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to other value. The following table shows Python comparison operators which was taken from [w3shool](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).

![Comparison Operators](../images/comparison_operators.png)
**Example: Comparison Operators**

```py
print(3 > 2)     # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 >= 2)    # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 < 2)     # False,  because 3 is greater than 2
print(2 < 3)     # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(2 <= 3)    # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(3 == 2)    # False, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(3 != 2)    # True, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(len('mango') == len('avocado'))  # False
print(len('mango') != len('avocado'))  # True
print(len('mango') < len('avocado'))   # True
print(len('milk') != len('meat'))      # False
print(len('milk') == len('meat'))      # True
print(len('tomato') == len('potato'))  # True
print(len('python') > len('dragon'))   # False


# Comparing something gives either a True or False

print('True == True: ', True == True)
print('True == False: ', True == False)
print('False == False:', False == False)
```

In addition to the above comparison operator Python uses:

- _is_: Returns true if both variables are the same object(x is y)
- _is not_: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
- _in_: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(x in y)
- _not in_: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(x in y)

```py
print('1 is 1', 1 is 1)                   # True - because the data values are the same
print('1 is not 2', 1 is not 2)           # True - because 1 is not 2
print('A in Asabeneh', 'A' in 'Asabeneh') # True - A found in the string
print('B in Asabeneh', 'B' in 'Asabeneh') # False - there is no uppercase B
print('coding' in 'coding for all') # True - because coding for all has the word coding
print('a in an:', 'a' in 'an')      # True
print('4 is 2 ** 2:', 4 is 2 ** 2)   # True
```

### Logical Operators

Unlike other programming languages python uses keywords _and_, _or_ and _not_ for logical operators. Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

![Logical Operators](../images/logical_operators.png)

```py
print(3 > 2 and 4 > 3) # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because the second statement is false
print(3 < 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because both statements are false
print('True and True: ', True and True)
print(3 > 2 or 4 > 3)  # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 or 4 < 3)  # True - because one of the statements is true
print(3 < 2 or 4 < 3)  # False - because both statements are false
print('True or False:', True or False)
print(not 3 > 2)     # False - because 3 > 2 is true, then not True gives False
print(not True)      # False - Negation, the not operator turns true to false
print(not False)     # True
print(not not True)  # True
print(not not False) # False

```

# Day 4

## Strings

Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string. Any data under single, double or triple quote are strings. There are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types. To check the length of a string use the len() method.

### Creating a String

```py
letter = 'P'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "I hope you are enjoying 30 days of Python Challenge"
print(sentence)
```

Multiline string is created by using triple single (''') or triple double quotes ("""). See the example below.

```py
multiline_string = '''I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python.'''
print(multiline_string)

# Another way of doing the same thing
multiline_string = """I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python."""
print(multiline_string)
```

### String Concatenation

We can connect strings together. Merging or connecting strings is called concatenation. See the example below:

```py
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Asabeneh Yetayeh
# Checking the length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16
```

### Escape Sequences in Strings

In Python and other programming languages \ followed by a character is an escape sequence. Let us see the most common escape characters:

- \n: new line
- \t: Tab means(8 spaces)
- \\\\: Back slash
- \\': Single quote (')
- \\": Double quote (")

Now, let us see the use of the above escape sequences with examples.

```py
print('I hope everyone is enjoying the Python Challenge.\nAre you ?') # line break
print('Days\tTopics\tExercises') # adding tab space or 4 spaces 
print('Day 1\t3\t5')
print('Day 2\t3\t5')
print('Day 3\t3\t5')
print('Day 4\t3\t5')
print('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') # To write a backslash
print('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"') # to write a double quote inside a single quote

# output
I hope every one is enjoying the Python Challenge.
Are you ?
Days	Topics	Exercises
Day 1	5	    5
Day 2	6	    20
Day 3	5	    23
Day 4	1	    35
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
```

### String formatting

#### Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)

In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them.
The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.<small>number of digits</small>f".

- %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
- %d - Integers
- %f - Floating point numbers
- "%.<small>number of digits</small>f" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

```py
# Strings only
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am %s %s. I teach %s' %(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of circle with a radius %d is %.2f.' %(radius, area) # 2 refers the 2 significant digits after the point

python_libraries = ['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']
formated_string = 'The following are python libraries:%s' % (python_libraries)
print(formated_string) # "The following are python libraries:['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']"
```

#### New Style String Formatting (str.format)

This formatting is introduced in Python version 3.

```py

first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am {} {}. I teach {}'.format(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)
a = 4
b = 3

print('{} + {} = {}'.format(a, b, a + b))
print('{} - {} = {}'.format(a, b, a - b))
print('{} * {} = {}'.format(a, b, a * b))
print('{} / {} = {:.2f}'.format(a, b, a / b)) # limits it to two digits after decimal
print('{} % {} = {}'.format(a, b, a % b))
print('{} // {} = {}'.format(a, b, a // b))
print('{} ** {} = {}'.format(a, b, a ** b))

# output
4 + 3 = 7
4 - 3 = 1
4 * 3 = 12
4 / 3 = 1.33
4 % 3 = 1
4 // 3 = 1
4 ** 3 = 64

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of a circle with a radius {} is {:.2f}.'.format(radius, area) # 2 digits after decimal
print(formated_string)

```

#### String Interpolation / f-Strings (Python 3.6+)

Another new string formatting is string interpolation, f-strings. Strings start with f and we can inject the data in their corresponding positions.

```py
a = 4
b = 3
print(f'{a} + {b} = {a +b}')
print(f'{a} - {b} = {a - b}')
print(f'{a} * {b} = {a * b}')
print(f'{a} / {b} = {a / b:.2f}')
print(f'{a} % {b} = {a % b}')
print(f'{a} // {b} = {a // b}')
print(f'{a} ** {b} = {a ** b}')
```

### Python Strings as Sequences of Characters

Python strings are sequences of characters, and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects â€“ lists and tuples. The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

#### Unpacking Characters

```
language = 'Python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) # P
print(b) # y
print(c) # t
print(d) # h
print(e) # o
print(f) # n
```

#### Accessing Characters in Strings by Index

In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.

![String index](../images/string_index.png)

```py
language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n
```

If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.

```py
language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o
```

#### Slicing Python Strings

In python we can slice strings into substrings.

```py
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three) #Pyt
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
```

#### Reversing a String

We can easily reverse strings in python.

```py
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(greeting[::-1]) # !dlroW ,olleH
```

#### Skipping Characters While Slicing

It is possible to skip characters while slicing by passing step argument to slice method.

```py
language = 'Python'
pto = language[0:6:2] #
print(pto) # Pto
```

### String Methods

There are many string methods which allow us to format strings. See some of the string methods in the following example:

- capitalize(): Converts the first character of the string to capital letter

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.capitalize()) # 'Thirty days of python'
```

- count(): returns occurrences of substring in string, count(substring, start=.., end=..). The start is a starting indexing for counting and end is the last index to count.

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.count('y')) # 3
print(challenge.count('y', 7, 14)) # 1, 
print(challenge.count('th')) # 2`
```

- endswith(): Checks if a string ends with a specified ending

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.endswith('on'))   # True
print(challenge.endswith('tion')) # False
```

- expandtabs(): Replaces tab character with spaces, default tab size is 8. It takes tab size argument

```py
challenge = 'thirty\tdays\tof\tpython'
print(challenge.expandtabs())   # 'thirty  days    of      python'
print(challenge.expandtabs(10)) # 'thirty    days      of        python'
```

- find(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, if not found returns -1

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.find('y'))  # 16
print(challenge.find('th')) # 17
```

- rfind(): Returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring, if not found returns -1

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.rfind('y'))  # 5
print(challenge.rfind('th')) # 1
```

- format(): formats string into a nicer output  
   More about string formatting check this [link](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/format)

```py
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
age = 250
job = 'teacher'
country = 'Finland'
sentence = 'I am {} {}. I am a {}. I am {} years old. I live in {}.'.format(first_name, last_name, age, job, country)
print(sentence) # I am Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250 years old. I am a teacher. I live in Finland.

radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
result = 'The area of a circle with radius {} is {}'.format(str(radius), str(area))
print(result) # The area of a circle with radius 10 is 314
```

- index(): Returns the lowest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1). If the substring is not found it raises a valueError. 

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
sub_string = 'da'
print(challenge.index(sub_string))  # 7
print(challenge.index(sub_string, 9)) # error
```

- rindex(): Returns the highest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1)

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
sub_string = 'da'
print(challenge.rindex(sub_string))  # 8
print(challenge.rindex(sub_string, 9)) # error
```

- isalnum(): Checks alphanumeric character

```py
challenge = 'ThirtyDaysPython'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # True

challenge = '30DaysPython'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # True

challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # False, space is not an alphanumeric character

challenge = 'thirty days of python 2019'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # False
```

- isalpha(): Checks if all string elements are alphabet characters (a-z and A-Z)

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isalpha()) # False, space is once again excluded
challenge = 'ThirtyDaysPython'
print(challenge.isalpha()) # True
num = '123'
print(num.isalpha())      # False
```

- isdecimal(): Checks if all characters in a string are decimal (0-9)

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # False
challenge = '123'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # True
challenge = '\u00B2'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # False
challenge = '12 3'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # False, space not allowed
```

- isdigit(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers (0-9 and some other unicode characters for numbers)

```py
challenge = 'Thirty'
print(challenge.isdigit()) # False
challenge = '30'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True
challenge = '\u00B2'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True
```

- isnumeric(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers or number related (just like isdigit(), just accepts more symbols, like Â½)

```py
num = '10'
print(num.isnumeric()) # True
num = '\u00BD' # Â½
print(num.isnumeric()) # True
num = '10.5'
print(num.isnumeric()) # False
```

- isidentifier(): Checks for a valid identifier - it checks if a string is a valid variable name

```py
challenge = '14DaysOfPython'
print(challenge.isidentifier()) # False, because it starts with a number
challenge = 'thirty_days_of_python'
print(challenge.isidentifier()) # True
```

- islower(): Checks if all alphabet characters in the string are lowercase

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.islower()) # True
challenge = 'Thirty days of python'
print(challenge.islower()) # False
```

- isupper(): Checks if all alphabet characters in the string are uppercase

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isupper()) #  False
challenge = 'THIRTY DAYS OF PYTHON'
print(challenge.isupper()) # True
```

- join(): Returns a concatenated string

```py
web_tech = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React']
result = ' '.join(web_tech)
print(result) # 'HTML CSS JavaScript React'
```

```py
web_tech = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React']

```

- replace(): Replaces substring with a given string

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.replace('python', 'coding')) # 'thirty days of coding'
```

- split(): Splits the string, using given string or space as a separator

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.split()) # ['thirty', 'days', 'of', 'python']
challenge = 'thirty, days, of, python'
print(challenge.split(', ')) # ['thirty', 'days', 'of', 'python']
```

- title(): Returns a title cased string
